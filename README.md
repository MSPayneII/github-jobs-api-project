Project Idea

Build a fully functioning job board using the Github Jobs API (https://jobs.github.com/api)


Preview of Desktop Design (Frontend Mentor)

Build Features:
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and laptop/desktop
- Hover states for all interactive elements
- Event Listeners
- The 50 most recent jobs currently live on the Github jobs API are shown
- The ability to view a job post in more detail and actually apply for the job
- An adjustable color scheme based on a userâ€™s computer preferences.

The idea is from a Frontend Mentor Challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
The goal of the challenge: Use any tools I like to build the job board and get it as close to the design as possible. 
Frontend mentor provides the style guide but I am responsible for producing the code and getting everything set up

Things left unfinished
 - The css and functionality for mobile view needs work
 - The theme switcher works but resets on re-render. My plan is to use localstorage to solve this issue
 - The styling for various job details does not have a uniform look and feel. This is due to some job postings not using semantic html tags
 
 Next Steps
 - Refactor code using new techniques that I have learned
